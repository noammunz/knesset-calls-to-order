# Knesset Calls to Order
This project aims to utilize machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically classify instances of "calls to order" within the transcripts of Knesset (Israeli Parliament) sessions. By analyzing session transcripts, our goal is to identify various forms of order calls, facilitating a deeper understanding of parliamentary discourse dynamics.

## Project Overview
The Knesset Calls to Order Classifier is designed to parse through session transcripts, employing NLP algorithms to detect and classify instances where a speaker calls for order. This process involves semantic analysis, pattern recognition, and supervised learning models trained on a labeled dataset of transcript segments.

## Project Features
- Transcript Parsing: Automated processing of Knesset session transcripts to extract text for analysis.
- Semantic Tagging: Application of semantic analysis to tag transcript segments with relevant metadata, enhancing the dataset's depth.
- Machine Learning Classification: Utilization of NLP and machine learning models to classify segments as calls to order, with categorization based on the context and urgency.

## Data
Original Transcripts
The original transcripts of Knesset session meetings are pivotal to our analysis. These documents provide the raw textual content from which we extract calls to order. The original meeting protocols can be accessed at the following location:

Current Parsed Data
After processing the original transcripts through our parsing algorithms, the resulting parsed data is structured and categorized for further analysis and machine learning classification. The current version of our parsed dataset is available here:
